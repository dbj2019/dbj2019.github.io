Hello,
I am a passionate and dedicated Ph.D. scholar, investigating the circadian clock-controlled regulation of physiology and metabolism at the post-transcriptional and translational levels.
I completed my master's degree in Biotechnology from SRTM University. In my postgraduation, I learned basic molecular biology and proteomics techniques in Dr. Yogendra Sharma's lab during my internship at CCMB. Additionally in my M.Sc. first year I received an Award of excellence in NGS data handling in the international workshop on ‘GBS Data Handling’ in an acquaintance with SAS organized by Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University in collaboration with Washington State University Molecular Plant Sciences on 2-12 February 2019. Besides academics, I love travelling to new places and meeting people. In my free time, I like to play basketball.
