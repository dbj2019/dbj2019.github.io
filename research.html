    circadian clocks regulates the daily physiology of an organism according to the time of the day. Transcription and
    Translational Feedback Loops (TTFLs) are believed to be the underlined molecular mechanism responsible for this
    daily regulation of the physiology. However, recent
    studies have shown that the clock controls the physiology beyond TTFLs at the post-transcriptioan or translational
    levels. In my PhD project, using the single cell algae I investigate regulation of the clock at the
    posttranscriptioanl and translational level
