    circadian clocks regulates the daily physiology of an organism according to the time of the day. Transcription and
    Translational Feedback Loops (TTFLs) are believed to be the underlined molecular mechanism responsible for this
    daily regulation of the physiology. However, recent
    studies have shown that the clock controls the physiology beyond TTFLs at the post-transcriptioan or translational
    levels. In my PhD project, using the single cell algae I investigate regulation of the clock at the
    posttranscriptioanl and translational level

 <p><h1>Abstract</h1>
    Timing of biological processes enable organisms to sustain the diurnal fluctuations resulting from earth’s rotation.
    Circadian clocks execute this temporal regulation by modulating temporal expression of genes. Clock regulation of
    mRNAs was envisioned as the primary driver of daily rhythms. However, mRNA oscillations often don’t concur with the
    downstream protein oscillations. To assess the contribution from post-transcriptional processes, we quantitatively
    probed the Chlamydomonas proteome for two circadian cycles. Our study suggests rampant role of posttranscriptional
    processes in clock regulation of Chlamydomonas metabolism. We quantified >1000 proteins, half of which demonstrate
    circadian rhythms. Among these rhythmic proteins, >40% originate from non-rhythmic mRNAs and > 90% peak around
    midday or midnight. Accumulation rhythms of proteins rather than their encoding mRNAs shows extreme coordination. We
    uncovered new rhythms and accounted for physiological rhythms whose mechanistic details remained undocumented from
    earlier transcriptomic studies. We envisage our study will refine and enrich the evaluation of temporal metabolic
    processes in Chlamydomonas. Owing to Chlamydomonas’s unique phylogeny this study can lead to new insights into
    evolution of clock regulation across kingdoms.
