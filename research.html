        Circadian clocks regulates the daily physiology of an organism according to the time of the day. Transcription
        and
        Translational Feedback Loops (TTFLs) are believed to be the underlined molecular mechanism responsible for this
        daily regulation of the physiology. However, recent
        studies have shown that the clock controls the physiology beyond TTFLs at the post-transcriptioan or
        translational
        levels. In my PhD project, using the single cell algae I investigate regulation of the clock at the
        posttranscriptioanl and translational level

            post-transcriptional apparatus by Chlamydomonas clock</a></H1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    Timing of biological processes enable organisms to sustain the diurnal fluctuations resulting from earth’s rotation.
    Circadian clocks execute this temporal regulation by modulating temporal expression of genes. Clock regulation of
    mRNAs was envisioned as the primary driver of daily rhythms. However, mRNA oscillations often don’t concur with the
    downstream protein oscillations. To assess the contribution from post-transcriptional processes, we quantitatively
    probed the Chlamydomonas proteome for two circadian cycles. Our study suggests rampant role of posttranscriptional
    processes in clock regulation of Chlamydomonas metabolism. We quantified >1000 proteins, half of which demonstrate
    circadian rhythms. Among these rhythmic proteins, >40% originate from non-rhythmic mRNAs and > 90% peak around
    midday or midnight. Accumulation rhythms of proteins rather than their encoding mRNAs shows extreme coordination. We
    uncovered new rhythms and accounted for physiological rhythms whose mechanistic details remained undocumented from
    earlier transcriptomic studies. We envisage our study will refine and enrich the evaluation of temporal metabolic
    processes in Chlamydomonas. Owing to Chlamydomonas’s unique phylogeny this study can lead to new insights into
    evolution of clock regulation across kingdoms.

            enigmatic clock of dinoflagellates, is it unique?</a></H1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    Dinoflagellate clocks are unique as they show no resemblance to any known model eukaryotic or prokaryotic clock
    architecture. Dinoflagellates are unicellular, photosynthetic, primarily marine eukaryotes are known for their
    unique
    biology and rhythmic physiology. Their physiological rhythms are driven by an internal oscillator whose molecular
    underpinnings are yet unknown. One of the primary reasons that slowed the progression of their molecular studies is
    their extremely large and repetitive genomes. Dinoflagellates are primary contributors to the global carbon cycle
    and
    oxygen levels, therefore, comprehending their internal clock architecture and its interaction with their physiology
    becomes a subject of utmost importance. The advent of high throughput Omics technology provided the momentum to
    understand the molecular architecture and functioning of the dinoflagellate clocks. We use these extensive databases
    to
    perform meta-analysis to reveal the status of clock components in dinoflagellates. In this article, we will delve
    deep
    into the various “Omics” studies that catered to various breakthroughs in the field of circadian biology in these
    organisms that were not possible earlier. The overall inference from these omics studies points toward an uncommon
    eukaryotic clock model, which can provide promising leads to understand the evolution of molecular clocks.
